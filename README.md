Version 1.0
beings run around in random directions until they are in the vicinity of food (the black square).
When theyre close enough to food, they will walk to it and eat a little, replenishing their health.

Beings can be in 2 states, wandering, or pursuing food. For wandering, I generate a random number for the direction,
and a random number for the distance they should go in this direction. When pursuing food, they head directly towards
the food until they reach it and take a bite. After eating food, they are supposed to be sent in a direction opposite
of the food and they are full so they wont return to the food immediatly to eat again.
